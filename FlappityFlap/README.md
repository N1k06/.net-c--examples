# FlappityFlap

A simple 2d horizontal scrolling game using .net Windows Forms.

It might be necessary to **trust the project** origin in order to build it with Visual Studio.
A quick way to do it is the following:
- Open a Powershell window
- From the Powershell window, go the project directory by typing 
	`cd <PathToProjects>\FlappityFlap\FlappityFlap/`
- Trust the project by typing the command`Unblock-File *`
- Import the project in Visual Studio and build it!
